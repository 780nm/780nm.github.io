Some resources and inspiration I've come across and that you might find useful if you enjoy film or happen to run into the same problems I do with your aging cameras.

Inspiration
- [Fstoppers](https://fstoppers.com/) is a decent all round photography website. sometimes they have interesting articles, sometimes their articles are painfully elitist
- [Emulsive](https://emulsive.org/) is a great film-focused site, I like their 5 frames miniseries

Forums
- [Dyxum](https://www.dyxum.com/dforum/film-cameras_forum36.html) have a bunch of great forum threads, especially with rtegards to old Minolta cameras, which are my weapon of choice.
- [Pretty good home BW film developing writeup](https://www.dyxum.com/dforum/a-guide-to-home-bw-developing_topic37704.html)
- [Pretty good film scanning writeup](https://www.dyxum.com/dforum/scanning-the-scanner-article_topic105410.html#1262424)

Reference and Manuals
- [Butkus](https://www.butkus.org/chinon/) has many high-quality service manuals available for free, and is overall a great resource
- [Learn Camera Repair](https://learncamerarepair.com/) have good quality scans for a buck, they used to be free but servers ain't :frowning:
