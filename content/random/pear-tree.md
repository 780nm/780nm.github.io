Oh what I would give to be

A pear sitting, in a pear tree

Ripened the color of autumn leaves

Moved by the wind, I'd bob and weave

A life so simple. A life so pure

My entire existence, a succulent allure

My soul an auburn drop on a branch

In a wide open field, on a long forgotten ranch

I'd sit and wait, my purpose known

But I'd have solace, as I don't wait alone
