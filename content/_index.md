### Sean Bocirnea

Professionally, I'm a Ph.D-track Masters of Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.
I'm interested in research on gradual and dependent types and the implementation of gradual dependently typed languages, working under [Professor William J. Bowman](https://www.williamjbowman.com) at UBC.
For my undergraduate education I obtained a B.Sc in Honors Computer Science with Software Engineering, also from UBC.

Personally, I'm interested in photography, rapid prototyping and electrical engineering, and a host of other things.
Writings about my interests, professional and personal, can be found by category above or in the index below.
